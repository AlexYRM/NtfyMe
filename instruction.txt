    To change the station for which we monitor the prices, we need to change the payload only. To change the station
    from Petrom to OMV we need to change also the headers => origin parameter
    Go to the Petrom or OMV website, go to "localizator statii" and open Web Inspector and go to network and search for
"details.php", then go to Request, click on Raw and copy the Request Payload and paste it in the code.
    Change the name of the station in the "station_name" variable also. Easy :)
